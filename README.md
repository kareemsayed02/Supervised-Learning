# Supervised-Learning
Implement a logistic regression on MNIST for binary classification and focuses on preprocessing, regularization, and optimization techniques. Data is standardized, split into train/val sets, and L1 regularization with gradient descent optimizer is used to prevent overfitting. Mini-batch GD, RMS Prob, and Adam optimizers are explored
